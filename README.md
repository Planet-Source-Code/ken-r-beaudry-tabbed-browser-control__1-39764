### Description

This is just a simple control designed as a drop-in component to allow a Tabbed Browser environment. I was working on a browser for personal use using tabs and a few people I work with, including my IT manager wanted apps done, using the interface, so I dedicded to make this control to make it easier to create the apps quickly. You can Add/Delete tabs, Block/Query popup tabs (popups display in a new tab)

If you like this....Please vote....if not, don't

Any/All CONSTRUCTIVE CRITISISM is welcome....

Please be easy....this is my first submission and I thought that maybe others would find it useful

:-)
